# Exercises for Programmers
Solutions for [Exercises for
Programmers](https://pragprog.com/book/bhwb/exercises-for-programmers), by
[Brian Hogan](//github.com/napcs)

## Plan

I'm going to implement the solution to each exercise in a handful of languages.
Largely I hope to cover the exercises with Ruby and Go, and later Haskell,
Python, Elm, Rust, or C.

Each exercise has a few "challenges" appended, elaborating on the original
problem. I'm going to ignore this on the first run through, then revisit them
subsequently.

## Organization

Each exercise will have its own self-contained sub-directory within this
repository including a README to document the problem and related details.

Within each exercise directory will be sub-directories enclosing solutions, one
per language.

## Running the Solutions

How to execute the implemented solutions will depend on each language, among
other things.

### Ruby

All solutions were written with Ruby 2.2.3 (MRI/CRuby). With a compatible Ruby
installed they should all be executable in the usual fashion, by passing the
file name to the interpreter.

```
$ ruby solution.rb
```
Additionally, all of the Ruby solutions have a "shebang" (`#!`) specified, so
you may be able to execute them directly, depending.

```
$ ./solution.rb
```
### Go

All solutions in Go are written against 1.5.2. They can be built or run as-is
in the given directory, if you have the Go platform installed.

```
$ go build main.go
$ ./main
```
```
$ go run main.go
```
